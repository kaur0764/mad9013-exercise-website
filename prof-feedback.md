## Week 2B ----------------------

Great work! Love the comment organization. A few small changes:

- Make sure you are properly indenting your code. It makes it difficult to read and understand when the code is poorly indented. The Indent Rainbow extension is helpful for this!
- The white logo should be in the footer
- The logos in the footer should be wrapped in an <a> linking to the home page
